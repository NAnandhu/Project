                <p class="text-xl p-10 ml-16">Looking for one of the most relaxing hikes in Madeira, but still want
                    some
                    adventure? On the Levada do Caldeirão Verde hike, experience a calm forest walk, weave through
                    narrow tunnels, and picnic in front of a spectacular waterfall. There’s almost no elevation gain
                    too, so the this is the perfect hike for a lighter day in Madeira.
                    Since it is a flat, easy, picturesque trail, Levada do Caldeirão Verde is one of the most
                    popular hikes in Madeira. It really helps to get here early, especially in the summer months.
                    Two-way traffic along the irrigation canals gets a little tricky, so an early start ensures low
                    crowds along the way, at least for the walk out to the waterfall.

                    Here’s what you need to know to hike Levada do Caldeirão Verde Hike (PR9) and have the best
                    experience.
