                <p class="text-xl">Welcome back to my series on Kerala! If you’re new here, I recently set out on my
                    maiden trip to
                    Kerala and explored two places – Kochi, a beautiful seaside town, and Munnar, a picturesque hill
                    station. With its endless tea plantations and serene ambiance, Munnar reminded me a lot of my
                    visits
                    to other Indian hill stations like Coorg, Ooty, Darjeeling, and even Ella in Sri Lanka. We
                    didn’t
                    have high expectations before visiting Munnar, but we were pleasantly surprised by its beauty
                    and
                    the tranquility it offered. If you’re a fan of sweater weather, love reading a good book with a
                    hot
                    cup of tea, and soaking in breathtaking green vistas, Munnar is the destination for you. Seekers
                    of Solitude and Tranquility:
                    If your idea of a vacation involves disconnecting from the chaos of daily life, Munnar is
                    perfect. Imagine staying in a cozy hotel room, enjoying room service, binge-watching Netflix,
                    and taking leisurely walks amidst lush greenery. With so little to do in Munnar, this may very
                    well be your agenda.

                    Stag Groups Looking for Relaxation:
                    For groups of men on a stag trip, Munnar offers a calm and laid-back retreat. It’s ideal for
                    unwinding, enjoying a few drinks, card games, and embracing the serenity of the surroundings.

                    Retirees in Search of Tranquil Escapes:
                    Retired individuals who crave peace and quiet will find Munnar to be a great escape, especially
                    if they live in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.

                    Nature Enthusiasts and First-Time Tea Plantation Visitors:
                    If you haven’t experienced the charm of a tea plantation before, Munnar will captivate you.
                    Nature lovers will marvel at the breathtaking views, especially while driving in and out of
                    Munnar. The scenic tea gardens make for a delightful sight, and you can learn about the
                    tea-making process and explore the plantations. If you have been to tea plantations before,
                    however, you may find this to be a dull place to go to – in which case, only stop by for one
                    night.

                <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold"> Should You Visit Munnar?</h4>
                <p class="text-xl p-5">Now, it’s important to mention that Munnar may not be the most action-packed
                    or culturally
                    vibrant destination in India. If you’re seeking a place with a wide range of food, bustling
                    markets, adrenaline-pumping adventures, or vibrant cafes, Munnar might fall painfully short,
                    which I realized only after I got there. However, there are specific types of travelers who
                    would find their bliss in this serene hill station.</p>

        <div class="p-8">
            <p class="text-xl">
                A hill station and hamlet in the Idukki district of Kerala, Ramakkalmedu is one of the most
                beautiful destinations in Kerala, which cannot be neglected while having a trip to the Gods Own
                Country. Ramakkalmedu is located in Karunapuram Panchayath, just 15 km east of Nedumkandam in
                Thekkady. Ramakkalmedu stands on the Western Ghats at an altitude around 3500 ft above the sea
                level.

                The origin of the name 'Ramakkalmedu' is quite interesting. 'Rama-kal-medu' means 'Land of Rama's
                stone' or otherwise 'the land where Lord Rama kept his leg'. As per sources, one story is that this
                is the place where Rama kept his feet, while in search of his beloved wife Sita. As per Hindu epic
                "Ramayana' Sita was kidnapped by Ravana, the ruler of Lanka.

                While reaching Ramakkalmedu, you can only find wind all around. The place is known to be the land of
                wind. You will feel that the wind will make you fly and it will be very difficult for you to stand
                still resisting the wind. Here the wind blows at a speed of 35 km/hour, which is said to be recorded
                as maximum in Asia. Blessed with this wind energy, Ramakkalmedu is the second place in Kerala, where
                you can find a wind energy farm with a capacity of 12.5 MW.

                RamakkalmeduThe first wind energy farm in Ramakkelmedu was inaugurated in the year 2008 by then
                Chief Minister of Kerala, V S Achuthanandan. The farm was set up with private participation and now
                you can find around seven wind farm units here. The sight of the massive wind mills is very exciting
                to the visitors. You will find yourself as a very small creature in front of this huge structure of
                wind mills. Be at the place on evening to experience the complete effect of the wind. You can go
                near the wind mill but you will not be allowed to enter inside.

                ramakkelmedu hills in thekkadyRamakkelmedu is also famous for the statue of Kuravan and Kurathi. The
                statue is placed on the top of the Ramakkalmedu hills. C B Jinan is the architecture behind this
                beautiful statue, which was erected in 2005. From here you can have a panoramic view of villages and
                towns in Tamil Nadu like Theni, Cumbum, Kombe, Thevaram etc. It is not a tough job to reach on the
                top of the hills as you can use vehicles or if you want to walk that is also possible. But vehicles
                are not allowed to enter the statue premises. From here you can also sight the wind farm.

                There is an interesting story behind this statue of Kuravan and Kurathi. It is said that Kuravan and
                Kurathi are two historical characters behind the construction of the Idukki dam. The rocks between
                the Idukki dam are named after them. According to the sources, Kuravan and Kurathi helped the
                authorities to find the right place for constructing the dam. You can see the statue of Kuravan with
                his family along with a cook upon the hills. But tourists are not allowed to climb upon the statue.
                You can also sight a mandapam behind the statue, which has been built for tourists to take rest.

                Best season to visit Ramakkalmedu is from September to May. Rainy season can be avoided. The
                destination is around 36 km from Kumily. You can hire a taxi from Kumily to reach this place. The
                nearest railway station is Chenganashery (90 km) and nearest airport is Madurai (145 km).
